# Cupcakes
A website created in my Web Dev I class for my Introduction to Entrepreneurship class. Our Entrepreneurship class created a small business called Anna Marie's Cupcakery.

This website is designed to provide information about the business, showcase the types of cupcakes, and allow a user to order some delicious treats!
